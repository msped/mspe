                                    A Full Stack Developer from the North West of England using the Python 
                                    Django Framework to create web applications. I primarily use the Django
                                    Framework when creating web applications however I do also have 
                                    exprience in using Flask but I am open to learning new frameworks and 
                                    technologies.
                                    <br /><br/>
                                    I'm currently looking into learning React along side Django Rest 
                                    Framework to provide more visually pleasing and functional applications 
                                    for users.

                                    I started my developer story in 2017 when I was filling in and printing 
                                    off invoices for a friends garage everyday and thought <i>"there has to be 
                                    a better way to do this"</i>.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    I then went about learning and building a very simple PHP application to 
                                    be able to email PDF invoices to customers saving me & my friend time 
                                    from exchanging information and reducing the amount of paper invoices 
                                    being produced.

                                    Once completing this web application seeing what I had built was being used 
                                    and the knowledge I had gethered I decided this is what I wanted to do for 
                                    a living, <b>software development</b>. In late 2018 I enrolled with <Link href="https://codeinstitute.net/" target="_blank" underline="hover">Code Institute

                                    During the course I learnt fundamentals in HTML, CSS, Javascript, 
                                    & Python along with associated web frameworks Flask and Django.
